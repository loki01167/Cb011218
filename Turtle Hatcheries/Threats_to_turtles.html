                <br>
                <p class="threats_text">Sea turtles are seriously threatened by habitat loss and degradation brought on by coastal development and pollution. The destruction or disruption of sea turtle breeding and feeding grounds, as well as changes to the physical and chemical characteristics of the water and adjacent ecosystems, can all result from coastal development, which includes the building of houses, roads, and other infrastructure.
    
                <br>
                <br>
                The habitats of sea turtles can also be significantly impacted by pollution, particularly those caused by human activity. Chemical pollutants, such as oil spills and hazardous chemicals from industry and agriculture, can pollute the water and soil and kill turtles either directly or indirectly by restricting their access to food or by spreading illnesses.
                </p>

        <h5 class="threats_c">CONSEQUENCES:</h5>
            <p class="threats_c_p">Sea turtles and marine ecosystems suffer grave effects as a result of habitat loss and degradation brought on by coastal development and pollution. The destruction or alteration of sea turtle nesting and feeding areas can throw off the time and location of their migratory and breeding cycles, among other aspects of their normal life cycle. Additionally, pollution can impact sea turtles indirectly by lowering the availability of food and nesting places as well as directly by inflicting disease or death. For instance, oil spills may coat the turtles' shells and feathers, impeding their ability to move or regulate their body temperature. Additionally, hazardous compounds may build in their cells, impairing their reproductive and immunological systems.
            </p>
        <h5 class="threats_c">HOW TO PREVENT:</h5>
            <p class="threats_c_p">Combining tactics that encourage sustainable land use practices and lessen pollution from human activities is necessary to prevent habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development and pollution. Several such strategies include:
    
                <ul class="threats_ul">
                    <li class="l_style_threats">Establishing laws and protected zones</li>
                    <li class="l_style_threats">Encouraging sustainable land-use methods</li>
                    <li class="l_style_threats">Reducing pollution</li>
                    <li class="l_style_threats">Educating and raising awareness </li>

                <h4 id="poll" class="threats_h4_p">POLLUTION</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="threats_text">Many marine turtles are killed by marine pollution because they mistake floating plastic bags for jellyfish, which causes them to starve to death. Leatherback turtles, who consume jellyfish, are particularly vulnerable to this problem.
    
                <br>
                <br>
                Internal damage, malnutrition, and even death can result from sea turtles ingesting plastic, among other health issues. The immunological and reproductive systems of turtles may be permanently harmed by plastic waste that releases chemicals into their bodies. Due to their lengthy lifespans and tendency to amass plastic in their bodies, sea turtles are particularly affected by plastic pollution. As a result, even modest exposure levels may have a long-term negative impact on a person's health and wellbeing.

        </div>
        
        <h5 class="threats_c">CONSEQUENCES:</h5>
            <p class="threats_c_p">For instance, by destroying or polluting the creatures that sea turtles feed on, plastic pollution might decrease the amount of food that is available to them. This may modify the quantity and distribution of other species, which may have a cascade effect on the entire marine environment.

                Furthermore, by changing their behavior and reproductive success, plastic pollution can also have an indirect effect on sea turtle populations. Sea turtles could deposit their eggs on beaches that are contaminated with plastic, for instance, which might lower the likelihood of a successful hatch and raise the death rates for hatchlings.
                
            </p>
        <h5 class="threats_c">HOW TO PREVENT:</h5>
            <p class="threats_c_p">There are numerous steps that may be performed to address the issue of marine debris and plastic pollution:

    
                <ul class="threats_ul">
                    <li class="l_style_threats">Reduce use of plastic</li>

            <div class="threats_text_container">
                <h4 id="poll" class="threats_h4_p">HUNTING</h4>
                <br>
                <p class="threats_text">For plenty of reasons, turtles are hunted. Turtle flesh is served as food in various cultures and is regarded as a delicacy. Targeted hunting is encouraged by the market for turtle flesh, especially in coastal areas where turtle populations are high. Turtles are frequently caught by hunters using nets, harpoons, or traps in their natural environments.

                <br>
                <br>
                A rich market exists for the illegal trade of turtles and turtle goods. The stunning shells of some turtle species, like the Hawksbill turtle, are prized for usage in the creation of jewelry, accessories, and ornamental goods. In order to steal these priceless shells, which sell for a lot of money on the black market, poachers frequently prey on nesting beaches, hatchlings, or adult turtles.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h5 class="threats_c">CONSEQUENCES:</h5>
            <p class="threats_c_p">A dramatic drop in turtle numbers is the main effect of hunting. Due to their lengthy lifespans and limited reproductive rates, turtle populations can be rapidly reduced by overzealous hunting. Many turtle species are at risk of extinction locally as a result of this decline in population levels.

                Hunting impacts the natural reproductive cycles of turtles. Nesting beaches are often targeted, and the removal of eggs prevents them from hatching and continuing the life cycle. Female turtles invest significant energy and effort into nesting, so the loss of nesting sites due to hunting can disrupt their ability to reproduce successfully.

                The general loss of biodiversity is exacerbated by the extinction of turtle species owing to hunting. Each species of turtle has distinct ecological responsibilities and adaptations, and their disappearance might have a significant impact on the wellbeing and efficiency of ecosystems. The value that turtles give on an aesthetic, cultural, and scientific level is also diminished by the loss of biodiversity.
